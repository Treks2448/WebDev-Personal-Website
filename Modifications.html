                            A hobbyists keyboard is not complete without modding to some degree. There exist endless mods for keyboards, but there are some that are considered almost neccessary. The mods mentioned here are among the most common and certainly worth trying. They have been sorted into three categories: Aesthetic, Feel and Both.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Aesthetic Enhancing Mods</h2>
                        <div class="hline"></div>
                        <p>
                            These are the mods that make your keyboard look nicer. While most typists don't look at their keyboard when typing, its looks shouldn't be disregarded. The keyboard is a key element of your desk setup, so make sure it looks nice! Here are some mods that can help you customise the look of your keyboard.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Braided and Coiled Cables</h3>
                        <p>
                            Braided calbes are tangle proof, they look nice and they come in many different colours. You can try to pick one out that suits your keyboards colour scheme. It's like the cherry on top of a cake, but on a keyboard instead. Take a look at both coiled and straight variants.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Artisan keycaps</h3>
                        <p>
                            It can be argued that artisan keycaps change the feel of a keyboard, and indeed they do. Keycaps are in the "Both" section of this page. However, artisans are generally bought for their aesthetic element, so they've been put here. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some people really like them, some don't. Nevertheless, it's worth taking a look at them, especially if you're looking to give your keyboard a specific theme.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Feel Enhancing Mods</h2>

                        <p>
                            These are the mods that enhance the typing sensation on a keyboard. These add just that small amount of extra satisfaction factor, hence they're worth taking a look at.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Switch Lubrication</h3>
                        <p>
                           Most siwtches contain parts which slide against each other. Friction is inevitable and can cause undesirable effects when typing. Lubing switches can help resolve that problem. It can also make them more quiet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When it comes to lubrication of switches, the general consencus is that "less is more", so be careful not to overlube your switches. You can also lube the sliders on the longer keys for added effect. Use thin lube for switches and thick lube for sliders. Here is a great video showing how to lube mechanical switches:
                        </p>

                            <iframe class="video" width="789" height="444" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSgPKPoFo2k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        </div>
                        <h3>O-rings</h3>
                        <p>
                            O-rings are little rubber bands that fit onto the stem of your keycap. They prevent the keycap from hitting the plastic casing of the switch. This cushions the feel of bottoming out a key, reduces its travel distance and dampens the sound it makes upon bottoming out. A linear switch with orings is very quiet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rubber in o-rings can have various densities, so the feel can be customised. You can also put more than one o-ring per keycap, which increases the effects mentioned earlier. Many typists dislike o-rings, but they're cheap and worth a try.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Wrist Rests</h3>
                        <p>
                            Writs rests can reduce the fatigue caused by uncomfortable positioning of the hands when typing. If your hands strain when typing, give one a try. Even if they don't you might feel more comfortable using one. Wrist rests are an item of preference, so try experimenting with something at hand such as a thin book or a plank of wood before you buy one.

                        <div class="hline"></div>
                        <p>
                            Here are the mods that enhance both the aesthetics and the feel of typing on a keyboard.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Keycap Sets</h3>
                        <p>
                            Keycaps are a huge part of the typing experience. They take up most of the space on a board, so it's important to have a set that look good. Furthermore, the material and the quality of the material that the keycap is made of changes the typing sensation. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Keycaps come in many grades of plastic. The recommended plastic is doubleshot PBT. It's the highest grade available and makes the keyboard feel more solid. Plastics come in pretty much any colour you want, so the possibilities are endless.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Alternatively, there are also wooden and metal keycaps. Each of these has a different effect on the feel of the keyboard. The problem with wood and metal is that they don't come in a large variety of colours, which limits customisability.    
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is highly recommended that you get yourself a set of keycaps. If you do decide to buy some keycaps, pay attention to the layout they're being sold in and the type of switch they're being sold for.
