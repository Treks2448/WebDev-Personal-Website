            <h1>Switches</h1>
            <p>
                Switches are the mechanism that is located underneath a key which, when pressed, send inputs from the keyboard. The switch is almost undeniably the most important part of the keyboard. It has the larges effect on how it feels to type on the keyboard. It is also the most customizable part of the keyboard. There are different kinds of switches - with differing mechanisms. Individual types can be sorted into categories. There are many options to choose from. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Before explaining switch types, there is some frequently used terminology that needs to be understood:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Travel distance - How far down the switch needs to be pressed before it stops moving</li>
                <li>Bottoming out - When a switch stops moving after being pressed down (when it is pressed all the way down)</li>
                <li>Actuation - The point when the switch sends a signal through the keyboard upon being pressed</li>
                <li>Actuation distance - How far down the switch needs to be pressed to send an input from the keyboard</li>
                <li>Tactility - How much feedback there is just before actuation of the switch (switches that aren't tactile provide a linear resistance until the switch bottoms out)</li>
                <li>Weigth/Heaviness - How much force is required to actuate the switch</li>
                <li>Clickiness - A term used to describe how loud the actuation of the switch is</li>
                <li>Clackiness - A term used to describe how loud the bottoming out of the switch is</li>
            </ul>

                <h2>Rubber Dome Switch</h2>
                <img src="RubberDomeImage.png" alt="Image of a rubber dome switch">
                <p>
                    Rubber domes are the most common type of switch. This is because they are cheap to manufacture, are quite resistance to damage and are relatively durable. However, they're also the worst quality switches in terms of feel. There are, of course, high quality rubber dome keyboards, but at the price that they come, you're better off with an alternative switch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the name suggests, the rubber dome switch has a dome shaped piece of silicone that sits above a button. The dome provides resistance when pressed. If enough force is used, the dome collapses and presses the switch under it, which happens approximately at the start of travel of the switch. This design is simple, but has several flaws. The largest one of these is that the dome is inconsistent. Domes will collapse under different pressures, which makes it harder to build up muscle memory on when the switch will actuate. Touch typing becomes more difficult as a result. They shape of the dome also makes the switch quite wobbly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another flaw with rubber domes is that they are frequently heavy. While some people prefer typing on heavy switches, they are much more fatiguing to type on for long periods of time. If you type or hold keys down for long periods and it is causing you strain, then you should definitely consider getting a keyboard with lighter switches, such as mechanical or electro-capacitive options.

                <h2>Scissor Switch</h2>
                <img src="ScissorSwitchImage.png" alt="Image of a scissor switch">
                <p>
                    Scissor switches are structurally similar to rubber dome switches, but they also have a scissor shaped mechanism which supports the switch. This has the advantage of making the switch more consistent and lighter. It also allows the key to be modified for a much lower profile than most switches. This switch is seen in laptop keyboards. Some people really like low profile switches, whilst others despise them.

                        Mechanical switches use a lever mechanism that is lifted by pressing down the switch. When the lever is lifed far enough, it completes a circuit and actuates the swtich. This happens at a very precise point, which makes the mechanical switch consistent and predictable. The part of the switch that pushes the lever can be shaped to achieve a desirable resistance at certain points in the switches travel. This changes how tactile the siwtch is
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mechanical switches do not collapse or actuate at the start of their travel. This means that they can be pressed down a small distance before they send an input through the keyboard. Most typists are indifferent about this, but some claim it to be an advantage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The quality of a mechanical switch varies depending on the manufacturer. The highest quality manufacturers are Cherry, but other brands, such as Gateron, come close. Either way, a mechanical keyboard is considered an upgrade from a rubber dome or scissor switch.

                        Mechanical switches are the most popular among enthusiasts. They come in a massive variety of categories, all of which have different tactility, clickyness, weight and travel distance. They come as individual switches, which can be taken off the circuit board and replaced with any other mechanical switch. There are probably hundreds of options and combinations to choose from, so you can customise your keybaord with these switches to perfection. This is part of the reason why they are very popular among enthusiasts.                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other reasons why mehcanical switches are so popular include: their consistency in actuation distance and travel distance, the satisfying tactile feedback (or the lack of it, in some cases), their clickiness and their clackiness.

                    <h3>Types of Mechanical switch</h3>
                    <p>
                        While there are probably several dozen types of mechanical switch to choose from, they can be classified into certain categories, and the most popular switches can be named.

                        As mentioned previously, mechanical switches can be shaped to provide a tactile sensation upon actuating the switch. These types of swtiches are called tactile. Most switches, mechanical or not, are tactile. An exameple of a tactile mechanical switch is the Cherry MX Brown. Mechanical switches are can also be shaped to provide no extra resistance upon actuation. These are called linear switches. An example is the Cherry MX Red. In some switches, an extra mechanism is implemented to create an audible click upon actuation. These mechanisms often make the switch very tactile. An example is the Cherry MX Blue.
