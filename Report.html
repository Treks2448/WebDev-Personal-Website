            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="hline"></div>
            <p>
                The website is an attempt at informing its visitors about keyboards and customising them. It covers topics related to keyboards from an enthusiast standpoint, acting as a hub that hobbyists can refer to when in search of information. Simultaneously, it also introduces the topic to readers who are not familiar with the hobby at all. The aim is to provide detailed and concise information, which may enhance the users experience in using a keyboard, without overwhelming the reader.
            </p>
            <p>
                This website can be divided into four sections. These discuss different aspects of keyboards. Each section has its own page. The first of these sections is the "Boards" section. It discusses the various formats, sizes and materials that a keyboard can come in. It also explains the importance of each factor.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second section is "Switches". This sections names several switch types that commonly appear in modern keyboards. It also explains how they function and describes how they feel to type on. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The third section is the "Modifications" section. It describes some modifications and addons that enthusiasts frequently implement in their keyboards. These are sorted into the aesthetic enhancing, typing feel enhancing and a combination of both.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final section is a guide that introduces the user to the topic of keyboards, walks them through the process of deciding what they want from a keyboard and how to achieve what they want. Additionally, it features recommendations based on the users preferences. 
            </p>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <div class="hline"></div>
            <p>
                There is a spectrum of potential users that will access this website. It starts from people who jave no more than a basic level of understanding of what a keyboard is and ends with hobbyists/enthusiasts who have a high level understanding of the structure, elements, building process and history of keyboards. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a hobbyist website. It is built as a result of personal enthusiasm for and enjoyment of the topic. This means that the goal is not only to be informative about the topic, but also to introduce the topic to potential hobbyists that visit the website. Therefore, the website should appeal to the entire spectrum of visitors. The only audiences that it does not appeal to, are those who cannot use a keyboard or do not know what a keybaord is.
            </p>
            <p>
                To fulfil this goal, the website should contain information that is detailed, concise and non-overwhelming - so that both experienced and inexperienced hobbyists benefit from using it. The more complex and detailed information should be easily differentiated from the more essential and simple information. Both sets of information should be easily available upon accessing the website. The user should be pointed to sections of relative importance to them.
            </p>
            <p>
                It should also be considered that keyboards are mainly used for inputing data into a computer. Whether typing or using function keys, the main interaction with a keyboard is through touch. Users for who this is important should be taken into consideration. An example is blind peope, who mainly use keyboards to interact with the computer.
            </p>
            <p>
                A lot of inspiration and research came from the MechanicalKeyboards subreddit "https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/". This is a forum for posting about and discussing keyboards. A large amount of the hobbyist community resides there. Posts often contain images of custom keyboard builds, which are a source of inspiration for entering the hobby and the creation of the website. What makes a good keyboard is mostly down to personal preference, and the subreddit offers a lot of opinions from the community.
            </p>   
            <h2>Planning</h2>
            <div class="hline"></div>
            <p>
                The homepage is most likely the first page that the user will view. This pages structure should reflect the previously mentioned requirements. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from the navigation bar, the homepage has a menu which links to each page of the website. Each menu item displays the name of the page it links to, as well as a short description of what information it contains. The items are sorted in order of importance, left to right, starting with the guide. This is because English reads from left to right, so it is most likely that the reader will look at the left-most (most important) elements first.
            </p>
            <p>
                The front page also contains a short, article-styled entry which welcomes the user to the website and tells them what it is about. This suggests to the user what they're going to be doing on this website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the text is a short video which demonstrates an example of a highly customised keyboard. The user can get an idea of what potential this hobby holds, both through visuals and audio.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, underneath the header there is a set of images that are made to fade into each other using Javascript. These are images of customised keyboards. They are there to give an aesthetically pleasing representation of the hobby. However, since these are purely visual and there is a large amount of them, they have been set to be ignored by screen readers. Instead, the reader continues on to the menu.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Boards, Switches and Modifications pages serve mainly as large collections of information. These pages are to be accessed by those who want to deepen their knowledge of keyboards. However, even these pages are not meant to be overwhelming to readers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each of these pages has a title in front of a background. The background serves as a visual element to help identiy what each page is about. It also gives the page a more appealing look - since most of the information on the page is textual.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following, each page has text formatted to give it an article style, making it easier to read. For example, on larger screens there are appear white columns to the left and to the right of the text, so that it takes on a book shape. The CSS @media property has been used to do this. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, three levels of HTML headings (h1, h2, h3) have been used appropriately to segregate information. Underneath each h1 and h2 head, there is a CSS formatted div which looks like a horizontal line. This adds to the effect of separating information.
            </p>
            <p>
                A lot of images have been used to illustrate the information being presented via text. This is mostly to help users visualise what is being described/explained, but it also makes the article more visually appealing
            </p>
            <p>
                The guid page is similar to the other, article-styled pages, but it is much more brief and contains several links to the other pages in case someone wants more information on specific topics.
            </p>
            <p> 
                The websites general structure is relatively standard. There is a navigation bar that allows users to go to different pages on the site. It highlits the page that's currently being accessed and highlits the element being hovered over. The articles are in a simple format - black text on a white background and closely following HTML article format. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The page has also been formatted to scale for differnent devices. Examples include videos which retain their aspect ratio, images being fitted to screen size, various text formatting and dynamic menu/navigation bars. Finally, the website has been tested with a screen reader and adjusted for ease of use accordingly.
            </p>
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <div class="hline"></div>
            <p>
                There were several websites used when researching keyboards. Some websites were used for extracting relatively factual information, whilst others for opinions. A mixture of both was implemented when writing the website - where appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most information on layout and form factor came from the blog post <a href="https://blog.wooting.nl/the-ultimate-guide-to-keyboard-layouts-and-form-factors/">The Ultimate Guide to Form Factors</a><sup>[1]</sup>. This describes the most widely used layouts and form factors as well as providing diagrams of them. Some of the images from this website were used, but the text was not directly copied.
            </p>
            <p>
                A <a href="https://www.dygma.com/mechanical-switches/the-ultimate-guide-to-mechanical-keyboard-switches-for-2019/">article by Dygma</a><sup>[2]</sup> was used when researching switch types. Specifications about mechanical switches were directly taken from the table on the webpage, but other information was simply interpreted. Other websites were used as well (in appendix). It should be known that the switch specifications are originally published by Cherry, Gateron, Outemu, Topre and Kailh, which are the manufacturers of the swtiches.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most opinionated information was referenced from posts on the Mechanical Keyboards subreddit and YouTube channels related to the topic. All of these, as well as images copied from the subreddit, are accredited in the appendix <sup>[5]</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of technical implementation of the website, there were several occasions where <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a><sup>[3]</sup> was referenced for HTML, CSS and Javascript solutions. Examples given on the website were used for learning how the mentioned languages function.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was a portion of code copied from a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33505032/fade-in-image-javascript">forum post</a><sup>[4]</sup> on Stack Overflow. This was a script which would add a fade-in effect to images. This was adapted and implemented into a script which would fade between several images at a regular interval. This is the script that fades the images on the front page. Some of the original source code remains. 
            </p>
            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <div class="hline"></div>
            <p>
                There are several solutions which produced a good result in the final website. One of these was the CSS formatting for the article layout. The layout is responsive, preserving a good structure on various devices. It is easily readable, whilst preserving the colour scheme of the website. The font is also similar to that of classical typewriters, which goes well with the theme of the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, the stucture of the website was well implemented. The front page is simple and points to all of the more informative pages on the site, prioritising the guide, which provides some of the most essential knowledge and in turn points to the more detailed pages. The information flow on the website starts with the simplest and ends at the more complex. In addition, the website is responsive and works well with a screen reader.
            </p>
            <p>
                One element that worked well, was the front page image-fading script. The effect this script produced made the page feel more dynamic and alive. The changing images gave more colour to the page as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the Javascript code that makes this element function has some flaws. The is called using a function that repeats at a specified time period. The function being called gets deleted after it is finished running. This means that the fuction needs to find the images, fill an array with them and then add the fading effect each time its called. While this works, it's inefficient and there is most likely a better solution. This could be improved with a better knowledge of Javascript and its libraries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the fading image element, as well as the background images on the other pages have some scaling problems. While they are responsive, some of the CSS properties cause the images to center differently on various devices. The images can be adjusted manually for each device (with in-line css), but this is inefficient as there are potentially hudreds of different devices that the website can be viewed on. The process needs to be at least partially automated. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A potential solution to this would be forcing a specific aspect ratio and scaling images appropriately (with CSS code). This would prevent the scaling problem, but wouldn't help place the images in positions such that they look the same on each device. An alternative solution is to use javascript to set a "point of focus" on each image. The script can then translate the image in its container so that the point of focus is in the center. This would be independent of the display resolution of the device.  
            </p>
